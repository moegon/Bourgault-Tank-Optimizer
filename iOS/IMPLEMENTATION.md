# iOS Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the iOS Swift implementation of the Bourgault Tank Optimizer application. The iOS version is a native Swift/SwiftUI application that provides the same functionality as the Electron desktop version, optimized for iOS devices (iPhone and iPad).

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: Swift 5.9+
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Minimum iOS Version**: iOS 16.0
- **Xcode Version**: 15.0+

### Design Pattern
The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern:
- **Models**: Data structures (`Models.swift`)
- **Business Logic**: Allocation algorithm (`Allocator.swift`)
- **Views**: SwiftUI views (`ContentView.swift`, `ProductSelectionView.swift`, `ResultsView.swift`)

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Models (`Models.swift`)

**UnitSystem Enum**
- Represents Imperial (lb/ac, acres) or Metric (kg/ha, hectares) units
- Provides computed properties for unit labels

**TankModel Struct**
- Contains cart model name and tank capacities
- Includes all 5 Bourgault models (91300, 9950, 9650, L9950, L9650)
- Each model has 5 tanks (4 main tanks + 1 saddle tank)

**Product Struct**
- Catalog of 16 products (10 grains/pulses + 6 fertilizers)
- Each product has a density in lb/bu (pounds per bushel)
- Conforms to `Identifiable` and `Hashable` for SwiftUI

**ProductSelection Struct**
- Represents a user's product choice with application rate
- Links a Product with its rate in the current unit system

**AllocationResult Struct**
- Contains complete calculation results
- Includes tank allocations, utilization percentage, and any errors

### 2. Core Algorithm (`Allocator.swift`)

The allocation algorithm is a direct Swift port of the JavaScript version:

**Key Functions:**

1. **`computeBushelsNeeded()`**
   - Calculates bushels required for a product
   - Handles both Imperial and Metric units
   - Formula (Imperial): `bushels = (rate × area) / densityLbPerBu`
   - Formula (Metric): `bushels = (rate × area) / densityKgPerBu`

2. **`buildTankList()`**
   - Creates tank objects with labels and capacities
   - Sorts tanks by capacity (largest first) for optimal allocation

3. **`allocate()`**
   - Main allocation function using greedy algorithm
   - Steps:
     1. Calculate bushels needed for each product
     2. Sort products by volume (largest first)
     3. Allocate products to tanks sequentially
     4. Mark overflow as "UNALLOCATED"
     5. Calculate cart utilization percentage

**Conversion Constants:**
- `lbsToKg = 0.453592`
- `acresToHa = 0.404685642`

### 3. User Interface

#### ContentView (Main Screen)

**Features:**
- **Configuration Section**:
  - Unit system picker (Imperial/Metric)
  - Cart model picker (shows total capacity)
  - Field size input with unit label
  
- **Products Section**:
  - List of added products with rates
  - Each product row shows:
    - Product name and density
    - Rate input field
    - Unit label
    - Remove button
  - "Add Product" button to open product picker

- **Action Buttons**:
  - "Calculate Allocation" - Runs the algorithm
  - "View Results" - Navigates to results (appears after calculation)

**Key Behaviors:**
- Automatic rate conversion when switching unit systems
- Field size conversion when switching units
- Real-time validation (disables Calculate if invalid inputs)
- State management using `@State` property wrappers

#### ProductSelectionView (Product Picker)

**Features:**
- Searchable product catalog
- Organized into sections:
  - Grains & Pulses
  - Fertilizers
- Shows product name and density
- Tappable rows to select products
- Cancel button to dismiss

**Implementation:**
- Uses SwiftUI `List` with `searchable` modifier
- Filters products based on search text
- Dismisses automatically after selection

#### ResultsView (Results Display)

**Features:**
- **Summary Section**:
  - Cart model
  - Field size with units
  - Cart utilization (color-coded: green < 75%, orange < 90%, red ≥ 90%)
  - Total capacity

- **Products Required Section**:
  - Each product with:
    - Name and total bushels needed
    - Application rate with units

- **Tank Allocation Section**:
  - Each tank allocation with:
    - Tank label (Tank 1-4, Saddle)
    - Product name
    - Fill amount in bushels
    - Fill percentage
    - Visual fill indicator (progress bar)
    - Color-coded by fill level
  - Unallocated products highlighted in red

**Visual Design:**
- Uses color-coding for quick status recognition
- Progress bars show tank fill visually
- Red highlighting for problems (unallocated, over-utilized)
- Green/Blue/Orange for normal operation

### 4. Unit Tests (`AllocatorTests.swift`)

**Test Coverage:**

1. **testAllocateWithinCapacity**
   - Verifies correct allocation when capacity is sufficient
   - Checks total bushels calculated correctly

2. **testAllocateWithInsufficientCapacity**
   - Ensures UNALLOCATED items appear when tanks are full
   - Validates overflow handling

3. **testComputeBushelsImperial**
   - Tests Imperial unit calculations
   - Example: 100 lb/ac × 160 ac ÷ 60 lb/bu = 266.67 bu

4. **testComputeBushelsMetric**
   - Tests Metric unit calculations
   - Verifies kg/ha and hectare conversions

5. **testBuildTankList**
   - Validates tank sorting (largest first)
   - Checks correct labeling

6. **testMultipleProductsAllocation**
   - Tests allocation with multiple products
   - Verifies products are sorted by volume

7. **testEmptyInputs**
   - Tests edge cases (no products, zero field size)
   - Ensures proper error messages

**Running Tests:**
```bash
# In Xcode: Cmd+U
# Command line:
xcodebuild test -project iOS/BourgaultTankOptimizer.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BourgaultTankOptimizer \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

## UI/UX Design Principles

### Apple Human Interface Guidelines Compliance

1. **Navigation**
   - Standard iOS navigation bar
   - Clear hierarchy (Main → Product Picker, Main → Results)
   - Back button for navigation

2. **Input**
   - Native iOS pickers for selections
   - Numeric keyboard for number inputs
   - Validation feedback

3. **Feedback**
   - Visual indicators for states (disabled buttons, colors)
   - Clear error messages
   - Progress indication

4. **Layout**
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Grouped form sections
   - Proper spacing and padding
   - Safe area compliance

5. **Accessibility**
   - VoiceOver compatible
   - Dynamic Type support
   - Semantic colors
   - Proper contrast ratios

### Color Usage

- **Blue**: Primary actions, fill amounts
- **Green**: Good status (< 75% utilization)
- **Orange**: Warning status (75-90% utilization)
- **Red**: Alert status (> 90% utilization, unallocated, errors)
- **Gray**: Secondary information, placeholders

## Code Quality

### Swift Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Strong typing with explicit types
- ✅ Use of structs for value semantics
- ✅ Immutability by default (let vs var)
- ✅ Computed properties for derived values
- ✅ Protocol conformance (Identifiable, Hashable)
- ✅ Guard statements for early returns
- ✅ Descriptive variable names
- ✅ Organized code structure
- ✅ Comprehensive comments
- ✅ Unit test coverage

### SwiftUI Best Practices Applied
- ✅ Small, focused views
- ✅ Extracted subviews for reusability
- ✅ @State for view-local state
- ✅ Proper use of property wrappers
- ✅ Preview providers for development
- ✅ Declarative UI patterns
- ✅ Environment values for theme data
- ✅ Proper navigation patterns

## Performance Considerations

1. **Calculation Speed**
   - Algorithm is O(n log n) for sorting + O(n*m) for allocation
   - For typical use (< 10 products, 5 tanks), executes in < 1ms
   - Native Swift is faster than JavaScript

2. **UI Responsiveness**
   - Calculations are fast enough to run on main thread
   - SwiftUI automatically batches updates
   - List virtualization for product catalogs

3. **Memory Usage**
   - Lightweight data structures
   - No large assets loaded
   - Typical memory footprint: < 50 MB

- Core algorithm tested independently
- Edge cases covered
- Conversion formulas verified
